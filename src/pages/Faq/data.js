        question: "Why do some PRs have 'Pending' next to them?",
        answer: "There is a grace period this year which means that a PR must be open (or merged) for at least a week in order to give maintainers the chance to mark issues as invalid. Therefore, the PR will be marked as 'Pending' until that grace period has expired."
    },
    {
        question: "Why do some PRs show outside of October?",
        answer: "If you've submitted a PR on the last day of September or the first day of November, there is a chance of it counting if it is October in any timezone."
