# Hacktoberfest Checker [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Useful checker web app to see how close you are to achieving the requirements for a free t-shirt as part of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

**Updated for 2016**

* Updated design
* Hacktoberfest label support

You can get involved by picking up some of the issues labelled [hacktoberfest](https://github.com/jenkoian/hacktoberfest-checker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest) to help toward your tally!

## Running the app

* [Generate a GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to ensure you don't get rate limited as often.

* Export the GitHub token as an environment variable for Node.js to use.
    * Mac/Linux: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN`
    * Windows (cmd.exe): `set GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR TOKEN`
    * Windows (Powershell): `$env:GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR TOKEN`

* `npm install`

* `node index.js`

* Point browser to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Running the app within docker

As an alternative to the section above, you can run the app within a docker container.

* `docker build -t hacktoberfest-checker .`

* `docker run -p 5000:5000 -e "GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN" hacktoberfest-checker`

### Testing
The chosen test runner is [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - a Facebook project. You can learn more about Jest in the series of videos on [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-test-javascript-with-jest).

Jest can be installed both locally (package.json), or globally:
* You can install it locally by running `npm install`
* You can install it globally by running `npm install -g jest-cli`
* (BONUS) You can also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as an npm alternative. Just install Yarn with `npm install -g yarn` and then use `yarn` to install dependencies

Once Jest is installed, you're ready to start testing. To make everything easier we provided some pre-build commands in the package.json:

* `npm run test` or `npm t` will run all the test suites
* `npm run test:watch` will run Jest in watch mode
* `npm run test:coverage` will run all the test suites and it will provide code coverage
* `npm run test:updateSnapshot` will run all the test suites and it will update obsolete or unused snapshots (for more info on snapshots see [this video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-use-jest-s-snapshot-testing-feature))
* `npm run test:full` will run Jest in watch mode and will provide code coverage


## TODO (2015)

- [x] Ajax form submission
- [x] Fix ability to link to users that ajax fix above broke (e.g. http://localhost:5000/?username=jenkoian)
- [x] Implement an actual web page using Bootstrap or something
- [x] Add field for entering GitHub username
- [x] Cache usernames and etags to make use of `If-None-Match` to reduce risk of reaching rate limit on github API.
- [x] Show a list of pull requests in question
- [x] Add disclaimer (GitHub API only allows max of 300 events, so if you're a busy github bee, it probably won't do you justice)
- [x] *or* even better than the above disclaimer, use the search API rather than the event API
- [x] Add contextual message, e.g. 2/4 PRs done "Half way there", 4/4 PRs done "Way to go", 12/4 PRs done "Now you're showing off"
